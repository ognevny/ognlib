# ognlib
ognlib is created to practice Rust (for me), so you won't find any new code, that can be used for your projects. It contains code for operations under number digits, some power algorithms, radix numbers and some algorithms.
## Contributing
I'm open for your feedback! If you want to improve my code and explain everything that is new for me, feel free to open PR in GitHub repo.
## Why was it created?
Currently I'm learning Rust and I want to have practice on something, so I created this lib based on functions from [`ognfunc.cpp`](https://github.com/ognevnydemon/my-code/blob/master/dad-is-great-in-C/ognfunc.cpp) file I made for the another repo.
